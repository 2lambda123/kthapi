## Organizational belonging for a given KTH user account or kthid

Given an account name or "kthid", how can we look up the organizational belonging?


```r
library(kthapi)
library(dplyr)

user <- "hoyce"
unit_codes <- kth_profile_school_dep(user)

# organizational belonging for user "hoyce"
unit_codes
#> [1] "t"    "tj"   "tjd"  "tjda"

# use the first two levels of the hierarchy
slug <- paste0(collapse = "/", unit_codes[1:2])

# look up the english lang description for this "slug"
unit2 <- 
  kth_school_dep() %>% 
  inner_join(tibble(slug = slug)) %>%
  select(slug, desc = `description.en`) %>%
  pull(desc)

unit2
#> [1] "IT"
```

Via the so called "Legacy Profile API v 1.1" we have now looked up that __hoyce__ belongs to the organizational unit __IT__, at the second level (institutional level) of the organizational hierarchy.

A function that wraps the above calls and returns a data frame is provided for convenience:


```r
kth_belonging_institutional("hoyce")
#> Joining, by = "slug"
#> # A tibble: 1 x 3
#>   kthid slug  desc 
#>   <chr> <chr> <chr>
#> 1 hoyce t/tj  IT
```

The `kth_profile_legacy()` function returns a field called `worksFor.name-en` which represents the lowest level (often level 4) organizational unit name, sometimes provided in Swedish instead of in English, so cannot directly be used to determine institutional belonging.

## Level 1 and 2 organizational units

The KTH schools and departments (in this case for the first two levels of the org hierarchy) can be retrieved with `kth_school_dep()`.

In the listing we exclude the `kthid` identifier, but it exists also for organizational units.


```r
kth_school_dep() %>% 
#  filter(is.na(`_id`)) %>%
  mutate(row = 1:nrow(.)) %>%
  select(row, slug, desc = `description.en`, website) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```
